#  Assignment 4

---

## Objective
To configure multiple Jenkins agent nodes (Ubuntu, RHEL, and CentOS) and manage build distribution across them.  
Jobs should execute on agent nodes during business hours (9 AM – 6 PM) and on the master node otherwise.

### Method Used:
Launch slave agents via SSH

- Node Name: `CentOS-Node`
- Number of Executors: `3`
- Assigned Label: `assignment3`
- Assigned Job: `Assignment 3`
- Description:  
  SSH-based Jenkins agent setup for CentOS build execution.

- Number of Executors: `2`
- Assigned Label: `assignment2_part2`
- Assigned Job: `Assignment 2: Part2`
- Description:

## 3. Ubuntu Node Configuration

### Method Used:
Execution of a command on the master node

### Configuration Details:
- Node Name: `Ubuntu-Node`
- Number of Executors: `5`
- Assigned Label: `assignment1_part1`
- Assigned Job: `Assignment 1: Part1`
- Description:  
  Configured via “Execute command on the master” method to support Ubuntu workloads.

## 4. Time-Based Job Execution Logic

### Requirement:
- Jobs running between 9 AM – 6 PM → execute only on new agent nodes (Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS)  
- Jobs running outside that time → execute on the master node

### Implementation (Declarative Pipeline Example):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Run Job on Correct Node') {
            agent {
                label getLabel()
            }
            steps {
                echo "Running job on appropriate node based on time"
            }
        }
    }
}

def getLabel() {
    def hour = new Date().format('H', TimeZone.getTimeZone('IST')) as int
    if (hour >= 9 && hour < 18) {
        // Business hours: use agent nodes
        return 'assignment1_part1 || assignment2_part2 || assignment3'
    } else {
        // Non-business hours: use master
        return 'master'
    }
}
```

## 5. Verification Summary

| Node Name     | Executors | Launch Method              | Assigned Job           | Status |
|----------------|------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Ubuntu-Node    | 5          | Execute command on Master  | Assignment 1: Part1    | Verified |
| RHEL-Node      | 2          | SSH Agent Launch           | Assignment 2: Part2    | Verified |
| CentOS-Node    | 3          | SSH Agent Launch           | Assignment 3           | Verified |
| Master Node    | Default    | Built-in Jenkins Master    | Backup Execution Node  | Verified |

## 6. Conclusion
All agent nodes were successfully configured with the required number of executors and assigned labels.  
Load distribution across nodes works as intended. Time-based job logic ensures that builds run on agent nodes during business hours and revert to the master node during off-hours.
